# Motivation Letter

**Dear Anne Keskitalo,**

My name is **Chenjing Zhuang**, and I am a third-year student in the Information Technology degree program at Centria University of Applied Sciences. I am writing to apply for the international co-operation project between Centria and Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences.  

Through my studies, I have built a strong foundation in programming, modern software development, and project management. I enjoy problem-solving, learning new technologies, and working collaboratively to design and implement effective software solutions.  

I have completed courses such as **Software Engineering, Modern Software Development, Software Testing, and Advanced Web Development**, where I worked on team-based projects requiring planning, coordination, and delivery of results. These experiences strengthened both my technical expertise and my organizational skills. In addition, courses such as **Fundamentals of Programming, Algorithms and Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming and Modelling, Cloud Systems, and Cybersecurity** have provided me with practical programming skills in **Python, Java, C/C++, SQL, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript**.  

In relation to the required skills, I have strengthened my knowledge in the following areas:  
- **UI Design** through the *User Interfaces and User Experience* course, where I learned to design and evaluate user-friendly applications.  
- **Networking** through the *IP Networks* course, gaining experience with TCP/IP concepts and socket communication.  
- **Application Development** through the *Modern Software Development* course, applying agile methods and working on full-stack projects under both Windows and Linux.  
- **Image Processing** through the *Data Analytics and Visualisation* course, where I practiced data-driven analysis and image-related processing.  

I am motivated to join this project because it offers the chance to **co-operate in an international team**, strengthen my **cross-cultural communication skills**, and apply my technical expertise in **real-world software development tasks**. With my combination of programming ability, project management experience, and enthusiasm for innovation, I believe I can contribute positively to my team and to the success of this project.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am highly motivated, self-driven, and eager to represent Centria in this collaboration with h_da. I am confident that this experience will further strengthen both my professional growth and international competence.  

**Best regards,**  
**Chenjing Zhuang**
